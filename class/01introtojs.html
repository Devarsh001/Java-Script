    JAVASCRIPT : 
    ==> it is client-side scripting language
    ==> JS is used to change behaviour of a website 
    ==> JS is used to make Dynamic Chnages in website
    ==> JS works upon the OOP concepts
    ==> JS works on DOM

    OOP ( object orieted Programming ) :
    ==> OOP is based on classes and objects
    ==> OOP was developed to make code more flexible and easier to maintain
    ==> OOP follows bottom-up approach to develop applications
    ==> Everything in OOP is an object
    ==> Object-Oriented is combination of two words; object & oriented
    ==> OOP refers to language that uses objects in programing
    ==> OOP is oriented to an object, rather than functions and logic

    Class (Logical Entity) :- eg., [cow,cat,dog ==> animal] [male,female ==> human]

    Object (Physical Entity) :- Instance of a class
    ==> An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
    ==> Everything in JS is object.

    -------- anyName(obj) = new ClassName ---------

    (CSS) BODY ==> (Java-Script) DOCUMENT / WINDOW (objects)

    DOM (Document Object Model) :
    ==> When a web-page is loaded, the browser creates a DOM of the page
    ==> With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML; such as:
        -> change all the HTML elements / attributes in the page
        -> change all the CSS styles in the page
        -> remove existing HTML elements and attributes
        -> add new HTML elements and attributes
        -> react to all existing HTML events in the page
        -> create new HTML events in the page

    ==> Ways to create objects in JS:
        1. obj.method()
        2. obj.varname (var = tag)
        3. obj.attributename

    Types of JS:
        1.Internal JS 
        2. External JS

    Always write script before the body ends; because html read code line by line.

<script>
    window.document.write('hello JS WINDOW...!');
    document.write('hello <b>JS</b>...!');
    document.write('<p>hello <i><u>JS</u></i>...!</p>');
    document.write('hello JS...!');

    console.log('hello <b>JS</b>...!');
</script>
