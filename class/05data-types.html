    Datatype: it tells us what type of value a variable holds

    ==> Types of Datatype:

        1. Primitive(Built-in) : numbers, bollean, string
            -> premitive data-types are pre defined data types
            -> premitive data-types can not be null
            -> premitive data-type starts with lowercase
            -> primitive data-type is simple data-type
            -> we can store single vakue in primitive data-type

        2. Non-Primitive : object, array, functions
            -> Non-premitive data-types are created by us
            -> Non-premitive data-types can be null
            -> Non-premitive data-types stats with uppercase
            -> non-primitive data-type is complex data types
            -> we can store multiple values in non-primitive data-type


    ==> to find datatype of any variable in console.log we use typesof operator
        -> types of is unery operator
        -> Unary Operators are the special operators that consider a single operand and perform all the operations on that single operand

        Syntax: console.log(typesof(varname))
