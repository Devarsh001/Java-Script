    Variable/Identifier: to strore values

    ==> Three ways to decalre a variable..
        1. using var (keyword) (default/global scope)
            (Keyword: reserve word which has the special meaning)
        2. using let (scope-related)
        3. using const (can not change the value)

    Syntax:

    var varname = value;
    let varname = value;
    const varname = value;

    var x = 12;// declaration
    x = 20 // assignment/intialize
    document.write(x) 

    ==> Rules for variable name:

        1. can't start with a number 
            var 1h==> wroong 
            var h1
        2. can't be keywords (var switch,,for,while,if,...)
        3, cant contain any operators,expression,special characters,space
            var x yz
            var x+y 
            var v%y


    ==> var :
        -> we can use any where in the code once we declare & it can be changed any where in the code
        -> re-declaration is allowed
        -> re-assignment is allowed

    ==> let :
        -> we can use it to a limited area of code & it can be changed in that area
        -> re-declaration is not allowed
        -> re-assignment is allowed

    ==> const :
        -> we can use it anywherebut we can not change its value once it is declared
        -> re-declaration is not allowed
        -> re-assignment is not allowed
